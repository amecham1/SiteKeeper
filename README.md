While working as a police officer I worked a part-time job at a security company. This company was growing quite fast adding new sites monthly. However, the way they kept track of the sites and scheduled thier 
employees was still done on excel spreadsheets. 
  
  This caused the entire process to sign up for a shift to be very difficult and often times you spent more hours trying to get the schedule right than acutally working the shifts you wanted. 
  
  I always thought that this process could be done better. Because of this I built Site Tracker. Site Tracker allows the security company to track each site that they are contracted with. And it also allows its employees to easily see shifts and then sign up for those shifts.
